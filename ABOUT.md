### More About Deepsteem

DeepSteem is implemented as frontend only Angular application (this way it can be run locally very easily). It uses steemjs to retrieve data from the STEEM blockchain. ng2-charts is used to display the diagram showing the share of self-votes. The current STEEM price is retrieved from https://coinmarketcap.com, using their REST API. Bootstrap is used for styling the frontend.



## We at Deepsteem want our users to enjoy more features in the future. Presently we are looking forward to 




* Displaying of a diagram of the price feed

and 

* Classification of followers into active/inactive

* Overhaul of the interface (especially visually)
