### MOre About Deepsteem

DeepSteem is implemented as frontend only Angular application (this way it can be run locally very easily). It uses steemjs to retrieve data from the STEEM blockchain. ng2-charts is used to display the diagram showing the share of self-votes. The current STEEM price is retrieved from https://coinmarketcap.com, using their REST API. Bootstrap is used for styling the frontend.



## We at Deepsteem wants our users to enjoy more features in the future so we are going to include the following 


* Classification of followers into active/inactive
 Overhaul of the interface (especially visually)

* Increase robustness by adding retries to requests   and fallbacks to other nodes if api.steemit.com is   not available

* Do not show STEEM column if SBD print rate is 100%
* Display a diagram of the price feed
